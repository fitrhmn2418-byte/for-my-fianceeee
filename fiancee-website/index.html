        <h1>For My Fiancee 💕</h1>

        <p class="message">
            Thank you for coming into my life when I needed someone the most.
            You found me at the lowest point in my life, when I was broken,
            lost, and unsure of myself.
            <br><br>
            You didn’t just stay — you helped me stand again.
            You listened when I had no words, you believed in me when I couldn’t
            believe in myself, and you loved me when I felt unworthy of love.
            <br><br>
            Because of you, I learned how to smile again.
            Because of you, I found hope, strength, and peace.
            You saved me in ways I don’t even know how to explain.
            <br><br>
            I am endlessly grateful to walk this life with you.
            I promise to love you, protect you, and choose you every single day.
            You are my safe place, my heart, and my forever.
            <br><br>
            I love you more than words can ever express and i love you the way you are 🐸💖
        </p>
